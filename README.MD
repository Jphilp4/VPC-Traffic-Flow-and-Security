# 🌐 VPC Traffic Flow and Security  

## **Project Overview**  
In this project, I explored **AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** networking, focusing on **traffic flow, security, and access control**. The goal was to understand how AWS networking components—**route tables, security groups, and network ACLs**—interact to secure cloud infrastructure.  

## **Project Highlights**  

### **What I Did:**  
🔀 **Configured a Route Table** – Directed traffic through an **Internet Gateway**, enabling public subnet access.  
🛡️ **Managed Security Groups** – Controlled **inbound and outbound traffic** at the instance level, refining my knowledge of **ports & protocols**.  
📜 **Created Network ACLs (NACLs)** – Implemented **packet filtering rules** at the subnet level for **an additional layer of security**.  
📡 **Explored AWS Subnetting & Routing** – Gained hands-on experience with **VPC segmentation and traffic control**.  

### **Next Steps:**  
🚀 **Implement VPC Peering & Transit Gateway** – Expanding networking concepts to multi-VPC architectures.  
📊 **Monitoring & Logging** – Using AWS tools like **VPC Flow Logs** for deeper traffic analysis and security insights.  

## **Why This Matters?**  
**Understanding AWS networking** is crucial for **cloud security and architecture**. This project deepened my ability to **design and secure cloud networks**, ensuring efficient traffic flow **without exposing unnecessary vulnerabilities**.
